# Restful Routes Basic Lab

## Objectives

1. 

## Instructions

Instead of keeping all your recipes on index cards (just like your grandma did!), we're going to be building a web app to store those recipes for you!

### Step 1

Create a new table in the database to store the recipes. Recipes should have a `title`, `ingredients` (which can be written as one string containing all the recipes), and `cook_time`.

### Step 2
Make sure you have a corresponding model and controller for your recipes.

### Step 3
In the `recipes_controller.rb`
